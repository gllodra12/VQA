In the notebook Task_3.ipynb, you will find how you can use a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to generate a predefined 4 qubit target state.

As it is explained in the notebook the first circuit doesn't achieve a good results because the number of layers is low. Once we increase the number of layers our circuit is able to generate the predefined target state.

I also add a requirements.txt in case anyone once to reproduce my results.
